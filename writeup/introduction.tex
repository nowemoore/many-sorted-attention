\section{Introduction}

Most data can be 

\begin{itemize}

    \item Most data can easily be represented as a graph with node features

    \item The message passing paradigm allows nodes in graphs to attend to each other

    \item However this paradigm has not been extended out of the domain of graphs

    \item In this paper, I provide an implementation of message passing over an arbitrary discrete data structure

\end{itemize}
